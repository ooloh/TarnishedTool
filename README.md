An offline practice tool for challenge running in Elden Ring (Currently only tested on 1.16.1, will be adding support for previous patches)

This tool is strictly for offline practice only, it directly manipulates game memory which violates Terms of Service and will most likely lead to a ban if you use this online.

Whenever specific features that could potentially be used for cheating in challenge runs are enabled, the loading screen title in game will change until the game is exited.

Includes:
* Saving / Restoring position
* Character cheats such as No Death/No Damage and more
* Change New Game Cycle (Including fia's champions)
* Grace / Boss warps
* Unlock All Graces
* Disable Ai / Enemies no Death and more
* Many options for the locked on target
* Hitbox View, Event view, Sound view
* Adjust Game Speed
* Noclip
* Free cam

* Stat editing
* Applying / Remove Special Effects as well as seeing active Special Effects on player
* Item Spawn / Mass Spawn / Item preset creation
* No Logo
* Stutter fix / disabiling achievements
* Force Elden beast to do elden stars into a specific attack
* Lock Lion phases / force phases
